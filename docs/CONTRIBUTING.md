## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This is one of the easiest and most helpful ways to contribute. If you find a bug, please make sure to include the following:
- A clear and descriptive title.
- A step-by-step description of how to reproduce the bug.
- The expected behavior and what happened instead.
- Screenshots or screen recordings, if possible.

Create a new issue on our GitHub repository to report a bug.

### Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to an existing one, we'd love to hear about it! Please create an issue on our GitHub repository with the following:
- A clear and descriptive title.
- A detailed description of the enhancement you're suggesting.
- Explain why this enhancement would be useful to other users.

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to Krishi Vikas? You can start by looking through our `good first issue` and `help wanted` issues:
- [Good first issues](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `good first issue` issues.

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Use the imperative mood ("Move file to..." not "Moves file to...").
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.

### JavaScript Styleguide

All JavaScript code must adhere to the [StandardJS](https://standardjs.com/) style. We use Prettier to format our code automatically.
